# PES-VCS Lab Report

## Course Information

- Course Subject: Operating System
- Subject Code: UE24CS242B
- Project Title: PES-VCS - A Version Control System from Scratch

## Student Information

- Name: Guru R Bharadwaj
- SRN: PES1UG24CS177
- Repository Name: PES1UG24CS177-pes-vcs

## Project Objective

This project implements a lightweight local version control system inspired by core Git internals. The system supports object storage, index-based staging, tree construction, commit creation, and commit history traversal.

## Implemented Components

The following core modules have been implemented as part of the project:

- object.c: object_write and object_read for content-addressable object storage.
- tree.c: tree_from_index for hierarchical tree generation from staged paths.
- index.c: index_load, index_save, and index_add for staging area management.
- commit.c: commit_create for snapshot commit generation and HEAD updates.

## Build and Execution

Use the following commands to build and validate the project:

```bash
make
make all
make clean
make test_objects
./test_objects
make test_tree
./test_tree
make test-integration
```

## Command Summary

Supported CLI operations in PES-VCS:

- pes init
- pes add <file>...
- pes status
- pes commit -m "message"
- pes log

## Screenshot Evidence

The following screenshots are available in the Screenshots directory and mapped to their corresponding validation steps.

| Screenshots/Phase4_ObjectGrowth_and_Refs.png | Object store growth and reference files after multiple commits. |
| Screenshots/Integration_Test_Start.png | Integration test setup/start state before sequence execution. |
| Screenshots/Integration_FirstCommit.png | Integration sequence output at first successful commit checkpoint. |
| Screenshots/Integration_FullHistory.png | Integration sequence output demonstrating complete commit history flow. |
| Screenshots/Integration_ObjectStore_and_Refs.png | Final integration state showing object files and HEAD/branch references. |

## Notes

- The author field used during commits is controlled by the PES_AUTHOR environment variable.
- The object store is maintained under .pes/objects with hash-based sharding.
- Atomic file update patterns are used where required by the assignment specification.
